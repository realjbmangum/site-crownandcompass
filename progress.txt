# site-crownandcompass Progress

---

## Session — Feb 21, 2026

**Completed:**
- Replaced white-background `logo.png` with inline SVG compass rose in Header + Footer
- SVG uses `currentColor` → inherits amber accent, no white box on dark bg
- Created `brand/` folder inside repo — all CC brand content lives here now
- `brand/brand-standards.md` — full design reference (logo brief, colors, type, graphic language, asset wishlist, AI image prompts)
- `brand/voice.md` — CC writing voice guide (moved from AI/ notes)
- `brand/logo-mark.svg` — standalone 200×200 SVG for design work
- Identified logo art direction: Heraldic Crest + Vintage Badge hybrid
- Wrote 4 style prompts + 1 final combined prompt for Grok mockups

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/Header.astro` — PNG → inline SVG compass rose
- `src/components/Footer.astro` — PNG → inline SVG compass rose
- `brand/brand-standards.md` — created
- `brand/voice.md` — created (moved from AI/CC/brand/)
- `brand/logo-mark.svg` — created
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated content sources to point to brand/

**Decisions:**
- All CC content (brand, planning, content) lives in this repo, not AI/ notes folder
- Logo style: Heraldic Crest + Vintage Badge hybrid — circular badge, shield, compass rose, crown, distressed texture, amber on dark, perimeter text
- Dev server runs on compiled dist — must `npm run build` before previewing changes locally

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Take Grok logo mockups and pick a direction
- [ ] Refine chosen logo in Figma or commission vector version
- [ ] Create OG image (1200×630) using final logo
- [ ] Swap favicon from Astro default to compass mark
- [ ] Add SendGrid API key + NOTIFICATION_EMAIL to Cloudflare Pages env vars (backend not live yet)
- [ ] Test join form end-to-end in production (D1 insert + email notification)

**Gotchas:**
- Dev server (`npx wrangler pages dev dist`) serves compiled dist, not source — always `npm run build` first
- AI/ folder is its own git repo — can't stage files from it in the monorepo
- All CC content should live in site-crownandcompass repo going forward
