# site-crownandcompass Progress

---

## Session — Feb 24, 2026

**Completed:**
- Full site redesign: Heraldic Crest + Vintage Badge visual language applied site-wide (4-agent team)
- 6 new CSS utility classes in global.css: `.divider-ornament`, `.label-flanked`, `.badge-frame`, `.rule-heraldic`, `.crest-corners`, `.shield-accent`
- All 4 components updated: Header (double amber line, wide tracking), Footer (flanked tagline), AvatarCard (badge-frame double border), PillarCard (shield-accent border)
- All 4 pages updated: flanked labels, compass dividers, heraldic rules, crest corners on key blocks
- Replaced all inline SVG logos with `cc.png` (Header, Footer, Hero)
- Favicon updated to `cc.png`
- Hero logo sized to 160px, top padding tightened to pull logo closer to header
- Renamed `CC LOGO.png` → `cc.png` (space in filename caused broken image)
- Compass rose SVG embedded as data URI in `.divider-ornament-mark` — every section divider site-wide now shows the compass instead of a diamond

**Files Changed:**
- `src/styles/global.css` — 6 new heraldic utilities + compass divider mark
- `src/components/Header.astro` — cc.png, wider tracking, amber box-shadow
- `src/components/Footer.astro` — cc.png, flanked tagline rules
- `src/components/AvatarCard.astro` — badge-frame, amber rule, heavier number
- `src/components/PillarCard.astro` — shield-accent border, corner accent, em dash
- `src/pages/index.astro` — full heraldic treatment + hero logo + padding
- `src/pages/compass.astro` — heraldic treatment throughout
- `src/pages/about.astro` — heraldic treatment throughout
- `src/pages/join.astro` — heraldic treatment throughout
- `src/components/SEOHead.astro` — favicon updated to cc.png
- `brand/redesign-spec.md` — created by researcher agent
- `public/cc.png` — renamed from CC LOGO.png

**Decisions:**
- All CC content lives in this repo under `brand/` — not AI/ notes folder
- Logo: cc.png used everywhere (header, footer, hero, favicon)
- Divider ornament mark: compass SVG via CSS data URI — scales site-wide from one CSS rule
- CSS data URI approach = zero extra files, infinite reuse across pages

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Investigate video not playing (check Cloudflare CDN cache, or OS prefers-reduced-motion setting)
- [ ] Refine cc.png logo into proper vector (Figma brief in brand/brand-standards.md)
- [ ] Create OG image (1200×630) using final logo
- [ ] Add SendGrid API key + NOTIFICATION_EMAIL to Cloudflare Pages env vars
- [ ] Test join form end-to-end in production (D1 insert + email notification)

**Gotchas:**
- Dev server (`npx wrangler pages dev dist`) serves compiled dist — always `npm run build` first
- AI/ folder is its own git repo — can't stage from monorepo, use site-crownandcompass repo for all CC content
- Filenames with spaces break as URLs — rename before adding to public/
- CSS data URI SVGs must URL-encode special chars: `#` → `%23`, `<` → `%3C`, `>` → `%3E`, `'` stays as `'`

## Session — Feb 21, 2026

**Completed:**
- Replaced white-background `logo.png` with inline SVG compass rose in Header + Footer
- SVG uses `currentColor` → inherits amber accent, no white box on dark bg
- Created `brand/` folder inside repo — all CC brand content lives here now
- `brand/brand-standards.md` — full design reference (logo brief, colors, type, graphic language, asset wishlist, AI image prompts)
- `brand/voice.md` — CC writing voice guide (moved from AI/ notes)
- `brand/logo-mark.svg` — standalone 200×200 SVG for design work
- Identified logo art direction: Heraldic Crest + Vintage Badge hybrid
- Wrote 4 style prompts + 1 final combined prompt for Grok mockups

**Decisions:**
- All CC content (brand, planning, content) lives in this repo, not AI/ notes folder
- Logo style: Heraldic Crest + Vintage Badge hybrid
- Dev server runs on compiled dist — must `npm run build` before previewing changes locally
