    "description": "The book that started more honest conversations in CC than any other. Eldredge argues that God didn't design men to be safe and passive — He designed them for adventure, battle, and beauty. The chapter on the wound is worth the whole book.",

    "author": "Steven Pressfield",
    "description": "Pressfield calls the internal resistance that stops men from doing their real work by its name, and then shows you how to beat it. Not a Christian book, but the diagnosis is accurate and the cure maps perfectly onto how men in CC talk about calling and discipline.",

    "author": "Bessel van der Kolk",
    "description": "Most men carry more than they admit. This book explains, in plain language, what stress and trauma do to the body over time — and what actually works to undo the damage. Hard reading, but essential for any man taking the Body pillar seriously.",
