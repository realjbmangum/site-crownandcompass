          <p class="lead-prose">
            The Compass is not a self-help program. It is not a syllabus to be taught or a
            curriculum to be completed. It is a map. A man picks it up knowing roughly where he
            stands and uses it to walk. The destination is not mastery. It is faithfulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four pillars: <strong>Body</strong>, <strong>Being</strong>,
            <strong>Balance</strong>, <strong>Business</strong>. They are not sequential. A man
            does not finish one before beginning the next. He lives in all four simultaneously,
            the way a house rests on all its footings at once. Some pillars are strong. Others
            have cracked and settled over the years. The Compass helps a man see which ones need
            attention — not to shame him, but to give him clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every pillar uses the same four stages to help a man locate himself:

          </div>

          <h3>Why the Body Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Paul wrote that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
            That word, <em>temple</em>, is easy to skip past. But sit with it. A temple is not a
            trophy case. It is a place where something sacred dwells. You do not optimize a temple.
            You tend it. You keep the roof sound and the floors swept. You treat it with the kind
            of steady care that says: something important lives here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stakes are practical before they are theological. A man who sleeps four hours a
            night is short with his kids. A man who has not moved his body in years cannot play in
            the yard with his grandchildren. The body is not separate from the life. It is the
            vehicle for the life. When it breaks down, everything in the back seat feels it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pillar is not about aesthetics or performance. It is not about the number on the
            scale or the weight on the bar. It is about being present, being capable, and being
            faithful with the one body you will carry from here to the grave.
          </p>

          <h3>The Four Stages</h3>
          <div class="stages-detail">
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Ground</h4>
              <p>
                Most men know where they actually stand with their bodies. They know about the
                weight they've gained, the sleep they've lost, the checkup they keep postponing.
                The Ground is not about discovering something new. It is about saying out loud
                what you have been quietly carrying. Not shame. Just clarity.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Path</h4>
              <p>
                The Path is a direction, not a program. Sleep is where most men should start —
                not because it is dramatic, but because it touches everything else. Seven to
                eight hours. A consistent time to bed. Less screen light before sleep. Food
                comes next, and simply. Movement follows. Find movement you will actually do
                on a Tuesday in February.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Walk</h4>
              <p>
                What marks The Walk is not consistency without failure. It is return without
                shame. The man who threw out his back and spent three months on the couch, then
                started walking again. The man who gained thirty pounds during a hard year and
                began, slowly, to eat with more care. Aging is part of this pillar, not an enemy
                of it.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Guide</h4>
              <p>
                A Guide in the Body pillar is not a trainer or a nutritionist. He is a man who
                has tended his own body long enough to speak honestly about what it costs and
                what it gives. He has failed and returned. He knows the difference between
                discipline and punishment.

            <h2 class="pillar-title">Being</h2>
            <p class="pillar-summary">
              The inner life: prayer, self-awareness, emotional honesty, and the question
              of who a man actually is when no one is watching.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Why Being Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Solomon wrote, "Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it"
            (Proverbs 4:23). Everything. Not some things. A man's words, his decisions, his patience
            with his children, his capacity to love his wife well — all of it flows from the inner
            life. When the inner life is neglected, everything downstream suffers.
          </p>
          <p>
            A man can look like he has it together. He can show up to church, lead his family to
            the car on Sunday morning, say the right things at the men's breakfast. And still be
            hollow. Still be running on fumes from a faith he inherited but never made his own.
            The gap between what a man does in public and who he is at 10pm on a Tuesday — that
            is the territory of Being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most men do not drift from God or from themselves in a dramatic moment. They drift
            slowly. Prayer gets shorter, then stops. Self-reflection feels indulgent. Emotions
            get compressed into two settings: fine and angry. And one day a man realizes he cannot
            name what he feels, what he believes, or what he actually wants.
          </p>

          <h3>The Four Stages</h3>
          <div class="stages-detail">
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Ground</h4>
              <p>
                The inner life has gone unexamined, maybe for decades. Emotions are either suppressed
                or expressed as frustration. A man at The Ground is reactive. He does not know why
                certain conversations make him shut down. This is not a place of shame. It is a
                place of naming. "Search me, God, and know my heart" (Psalm 139:23).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Path</h4>
              <p>
                The Path is where a man starts paying attention. He notices his patterns. He begins
                to name what he feels, even when the vocabulary is clumsy. This looks quiet from
                the outside: five minutes with an open Bible, a prayer that drops the formal language
                and says what is actually true. A man telling another man, for the first time, that
                he is struggling.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Walk</h4>
              <p>
                Years pass. A man who stays on The Path will encounter seasons when God feels distant.
                The Walk is long obedience in the same direction. He has walked through doubt and
                come out the other side, not with all the answers, but with something sturdier than
                answers. He knows that faith held in the dark is worth more than faith that has
                never been tested.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Guide</h4>
              <p>
                A Guide in Being is a man who has done enough inner work that he can sit with
                another man's doubt, confusion, or pain without flinching. He does not rush to fix
                it. He does not quote a verse to close the conversation. His inner life is integrated
                — he is largely the same man in public and in private. He says: "I have been where
                you are. I stayed. Here is what I found."

              Relationships: marriage, fatherhood, friendship, rest.
              The question is simple and hard: who gets the actual you?
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Why Balance Matters</h3>
          <p>
            A man can be faithful in the technical sense and still be absent. He comes home. He
            provides. He is there for the important events. But being there and being present are
            two different things. His wife knows the difference. His children feel it even if they
            cannot say it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stakes here are not abstract. A marriage can survive years of distance before
            either person names what is wrong. Children grow up watching a father who is physically
            in the room but mentally somewhere else, and they learn that this is what love looks
            like: a man who shows up but never arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Balance also includes rest. The Sabbath is a command, and a strange one — God tells
            His people to stop. To trust that the world will hold together for a day without their
            effort. Most men treat rest as weakness. The Sabbath reframes it as faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it includes friendship. "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for
            adversity" (Proverbs 17:17). Most men have acquaintances. They have colleagues. They
            do not have someone who knows how they are actually doing. The Balance pillar asks why.
          </p>

          <h3>The Four Stages</h3>
          <div class="stages-detail">
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Ground</h4>
              <p>
                The drift is slow. Staying late at work one extra night, then two, then it becomes
                normal. The phone replaces conversation. The evening becomes parallel silence. A
                man at the Ground has usually made peace with this arrangement. He tells himself
                his family understands. But if he is honest, something has gone cold.

              <h4>The Path</h4>
              <p>
                One real conversation with your wife this week. Not about the schedule — a
                conversation where you ask her something and listen to the whole answer. One evening
                where the phone stays in the drawer. Sabbath enters here as a practice, not a rule.
                One day where you stop producing and sit with your family without an agenda.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Walk</h4>
              <p>
                The marriage that has survived a hard season, a real one, where both people wanted
                to leave and neither did. The father whose adult children still call, not because
                they have to but because they want to. At sixty, The Walk looks like a man whose

              <p>
                A Guide in Balance can sit across from another man whose marriage is struggling
                and not flinch. He asks: how are things at home, really? And he stays quiet long
                enough to hear the actual answer. He has earned the right to ask because he has
                been honest about his own failures.

            <h2 class="pillar-title">Business</h2>
            <p class="pillar-summary">
              Work, money, vocation. Not about building wealth — but whether a man's
              labor serves his life, or his life has become fuel for his work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Why Business Matters</h3>
          <p>
            A man's work reveals what he believes about himself. Not what he says he believes.
            What he actually believes: what he's worth, what he owes, what he's afraid of losing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most men never stop to ask what their work is for. They were taught to provide, and
            they do. But somewhere between the first paycheck and the twentieth year, work became
            the thing that defined them. Ask a man who he is, and he will tell you what he does.
            That is not an accident. It is a confession.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul writes that a man's work belongs to God, not to him. "Your labor is an offering,
            not an identity." The moment a man grasps that distinction, his relationship to work
            changes completely. The parable of the talents is not about financial returns — it is
            about what a man does with what he has been given. Fear buries. Faithfulness builds.
          </p>

          <h3>The Four Stages</h3>
          <div class="stages-detail">
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Ground</h4>
              <p>
                Most men are working hard and not asking questions. A man earns, he spends, he
                provides. His identity and his occupation are fused together. Money is the other
                silence — most men do not know, with any honesty, where they stand financially.
                They carry debt or anxiety or both, and they carry it alone.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Path</h4>
              <p>
                The Path begins with honesty, not strategy. A man looks at his actual numbers:
                what comes in, what goes out, what he owes. Then a small step: give something
                away. Regularly. Generosity is not a financial strategy. It is a declaration that
                money does not own you. The question: is what I am building worth what it is
                costing me?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Walk</h4>
              <p>
                Measured in decades, not quarters. The man who lost the business at 38 and learned
                that he was not his company. The man who changed careers at 45 because the work no
                longer matched the man he had become. A man at The Walk holds his work loosely. He
                still shows up fully, still brings excellence — but he is no longer gripping.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stage-block">
              <h4>The Guide</h4>
              <p>
                A Guide in Business is not a financial advisor. He is a man who has wrestled with
                work and money long enough to sit with another man's fear. When a man confesses
                he is drowning in debt, the Guide does not lecture. He says: "I have been there.
                Let me sit with you while you look at this."

          <h2>How a Guide Uses The Compass</h2>
          <p>
            A Guide does not teach The Compass like a class. He navigates from it. Before a Chapter
            meeting, he reads the section most relevant to the current book. If the book this week
            touches marriage or family, he opens Balance. If it touches prayer or the inner life,
            he opens Being. The Compass follows the book. It deepens the conversation the book has
            already started.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pick one section within a pillar — not the whole thing. Read a short passage aloud.
            Start with yourself. Before you ask the men in the room where they stand, tell them
            where you stand. The room will only go as deep as you go first.
          </p>
          <p>
            End with The Round. Each man says one thing he is taking with him from the conversation.
            One sentence. No commentary from the group. Just a man naming what landed.
