          <h2>Where This Started</h2>
          <p>
            Crown and Compass started simply: a few men, a book, a Saturday morning. No strategy,
            no program, no launch plan. A man named what he needed — honest company, a structure
            for growth, other men willing to go first — and invited a few others to try it with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was the beginning. The community has been small by design ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's named for two things. The Crown belongs to Christ — the foundation and the
            authority. The Compass is for The Walk — the direction, the map, the orientation
            that keeps a man from drifting. Put them together and you have the frame: a
            community built under Christ's authority and pointed in a clear direction.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Brian's Role -->
        <section class="about-section">
          <div class="rule-heraldic"></div>
          <h2>Brian's Role</h2>
          <p>
            Brian is the Founder. That means he set the table, named the thing, held the first
            meeting, and carries the vision. It does not mean he is the permanent host, the only
            Guide, or the authority on every question.
          </p>
          <p>
            His job is to be the first voice and to shape the culture in the early years. He decides
            which books CC reads. He identifies and invites the first Guides. He holds the standard
            of what the Round should feel like when it's done right. He is Barnabas to the group —
            the one who encourages, who sees the potential in a man before the man sees it himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As CC grows, Brian's role becomes less operational and more foundational. The goal is
            a community that runs on shared culture, not Brian's personal bandwidth. That transition
            happens slowly, through Guides developing and Chapters multiplying. It does not happen
            by accident.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Walk Philosophy -->
        <section class="about-section">
          <div class="rule-heraldic"></div>
          <h2>The Walk</h2>
          <p>
            Everything in Crown and Compass lives under one phrase: <em>Long. Slow. Together.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Long, because the kind of formation we're after does not happen in a weekend retreat
            or a six-week program. It happens over years. A man who stays in a Chapter long enough
            will look back and be unable to name the exact moment things changed — only that they
            did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slow, because we resist the pressure to optimize. We are not trying to produce the
            maximum amount of growth in the minimum amount of time. We are trying to walk faithfully
            in a direction worth walking. That takes longer than most men expect and gives more
            than most men imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, because the entire premise rests on this: a man does not grow in isolation.
            He grows when other men are watching, asking, and walking alongside. The community is
            not the bonus feature. It is the point.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- What CC Is Not -->
        <section class="about-section">
          <div class="rule-heraldic"></div>
          <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
          <p>
            Crown and Compass is not a men's retreat with a follow-up newsletter. It is an
            ongoing community. The relationship doesn't end when the event ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not a self-improvement program. Self-improvement is a solo project. What we
            do requires other people. A man cannot Crown and Compass himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not broadly spiritual or interfaith. Crown and Compass is Christian. The Bible
            is our text alongside whatever book we're reading. Prayer is normal. Faith in Christ
            is the foundation. A man who is curious about faith is welcome. A man looking for a
            faith-neutral self-development group will find something better suited elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not free because it's cheap. It is free because the Gospel is free and because
            the best communities — F3, AA, the early church — have never charged for belonging.
